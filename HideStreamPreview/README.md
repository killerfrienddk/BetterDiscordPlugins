# HideStreamPreview

Annoyed that Discord doesn't let you hide your own stream? Me too. So I made a little thing that should let you go ahead and do that.

## Disclaimer 
This does currently not work on popouts.

## Instructions
 - Install and you're good to go!

## Settings
 - Enable/Disable hiding own stream when less than 3 streams are active
